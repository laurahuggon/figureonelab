# Figure One Lab (F1L) by Dean Lee

F1L helps users hone computational biology skills by re-enacting Figure 1 of modern biology papers:
* [Uzquiano (2022, Cell)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867422011680) is a study of human cortical organoids.

## Aim of F1L
From the [original repository](https://github.com/deanslee/FigureOneLab):
> Choose one of the F1L papers that piques your interest. Then go through the Jupyter notebooks accompanying the paper. Note that these are not polished notebooks by any means. They are rough drafts, so you can decide how to polish them. F1L believes in doing quick-and-dirty analyses first to develop an intuition for the data before working on the final version of your code/analyses. In these notebooks I demonstrate how a working computational biologist might think about reconstructing Figure 1. Run each code block. See if you can understand what was done and why.
>
> The notebooks only recreate a fraction of Figure 1, leaving much of the ambiguity surrounding the data for you to untangle.
